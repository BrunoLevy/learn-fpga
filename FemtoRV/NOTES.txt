=================================================================================================================

  Lessons taken:
             - simulation is important ! (of course)
	     - use generic primitives as much as possible, and let
	       yosys infer BRAMs (my handwritten code with SB_xxx
	       primitives used more LUTs than what yosys does)
	     - when there is a bug, it can be in the hard, but it
	       can be in the soft as well !
	     - femtorv32 state machine: choose good names for the states,
	       and be super clear about what's ready or not at the beginning
	       and at the end of each state. x <= y means that x will have value
	       y at the beginning of the *next* state (en Francais dans le texte:
	       "ca va sans dire mais ca va mieux en le disant" !!)
	     - reg is not a register, it is an abstraction that can be transformed
	       into a reg/latch by the synthetizer if need be.
	     - everything that appears on the left side of '=' or '<=' should be a
	       reg.
	     - number of used LUTs can vary in surprising manners ! For instance,
	       sometimes changing the *names* of variables has an influence (???)
	     - SSD1351 driver, send clock signals in the middle of the serialized
	       bits: do chronograms carefully, and everything goes much better !

  Observations:
             - RISCV is super-well designed and smart ! At the beginning, the design
	       decision they took may seem weird (32 bit constant loaded by two
	       different instructions, one PC-relative, or 5 different encoding for
	       the constants, with parts of the bits scrambled in different parts
	       of the instr, or special register x0), but everything makes sense
	       when you write the instr decoder:
	          - source and dest registers (5 bits) always at the same position
		  - ALU op always at the same position
		  - sign-expanded bit always at the same position
	       Consequence: decoder uses a minimal number of gates, has low logic
	       depth, its outputs do not need to be latched.
	     - Coding in RISCV assembly is easier than I thought: few instructions
	       to remember, so can be learnt quickly ! And for the somewhat weird
	       instructions (lui, auipc, jal, jalr), the 'pseudo-instructions'
	       (li, la, call, ret, branch variants) make things easier. The ABI
	       register names make thing easier as well. 
             - Having an assembler, linker, c compiler ready is fantastic !
	       The only difficult part was:
	          1) finding the right switch to generate pure RV32I instructions
		  2) finding a way of generating an ELF and extracting the raw content
		  3) converting this raw content into a form that VERILOG's $readmemh()
		     can understand.

  DebugLog:
             - Un bug qui m'a fait croire que mon IceStick était toasté:
	       Dans femtosoc.v, pour tester le negatice reset / bouton ON de l'ULX3S,
	       j'avais remplacé reset = &reset_cnt par reset = |reset_cnt, et ça
	       invalide du coup totalement mon mécanisme de délai/reset.

             - scrolling dans tty: il reste tjrs une ligne vide à la
               fin, à cause du retour chariot de la dernière ligne !
	       En fait, il ne faudrait pas scroller au retour chariot, mais
	       scroller au premier caractère de la ligne suivante !!
	     - le menu est bouzillé !!  
	       
             - un bug à la gomme du même genre: printf() ne printait rien du tout
	       sur SSD1331: c'est encore à cause de NRV_IO_SSD1351_SSD1331: dans
	       HardwareConfig, je ne pensais pas à positionner le bit à 1 dans
	       le registre device (qui était positionné par NRV_IO_SSD1351 au lieu
	       de NRV_IO_SSD1351_1331) ... mais en fait ça marche tjrs pas !
	       ... parceque HardwareConfig.v était inclus *avant* SSD1351_1331.v,
	       donc il ne voyait pas encore NRV_IO_SSD1351_1331 défini par celui-ci !
 
             - un bug terrible ! mon petit programme pour ecran
               SSD1331 marchait, et ensuite plus après évolution RTL et C
	       -> j'ai cherché le bug dans le C, ça venait du RTL:
	          apres avoir ajouté une config NRV_IO_SSD1351_SSD1331, il
		  restait un `ifdef NRV_IO_SSD1351 à la fin de femtosoc.v,
		  pour le signal d'attente !!
		  
             - test_FGA.c: uint16_t* graph_mem = (uint16_t)FGA_BASEMEM;
	                                              ^___ Manquait une étoile ici !!!
                et cet andouille de compilo C me disait rien ! Perdu 1h avec ça,
		je croyais qu'écriture processeur->VRAM ne marchait plus !
             - FGA, accelerated horizontal lines
	         - J'avais oublié d'appeler wait_GPU() (donc ça ne marchait pas au delà d'une certaine longueur)
		 - Il y a parfois dans ST_NICCC des polygones en
                   "papillon", avec xleft à droite de xright donc la boucle 'hardware' s'arretait a
                   la ligne suivante !
             - FGA, emulation du SSD1351
	         a) j'ai oublié de conditionner à io_wstrb
		 b) quand il y a plusieurs <= dans un bloc, j'ai
                    tendance à oublier qu'ils ne sont pas séquentiels entre eux, et à faire
		    par exemple:
		        x1 <= mem_wdata;
			x  <= x1;
		    en voulant dire:
		        x1 <= mem_wdata;
			x  <= mem_wdata;
  
             - Everything seemed to be broken after I generated all IO
               register IDs from VERILOG sources, in fact I was
               reading frequency and "cycles per loop" from
               DEVICES_FREQ_bit instead of DEVICES_FREQ (defines for
               NRV_FREQ and NRV_CPL in femtorv32.h)
  
             - Timing was VERY different between mini-femtorv32 and femtorv32,
	       it was because I was *always* writing to the ALU in EXECUTE state,
	       randomly loading shift operations and causing wait alu waiting !
	       
             - Had several difficulties introducing a wait state for IOs:
	        STORE:
	           a) everything can't be done in the STORE state, because
		      when we enter the STORE state, mem_wenable and mem_address
		      where just set by execute, thus mem_wbusy will be set
		      at the next cycle -> new WAIT_IO_STORE state.
		   b) stupid error in WAIT_IO_STORE and WAIT_IO_STORE_bit constants !!!
		   ---> found the bug by simulation (again, simulation: do-it-or-die !!)
		   ---> side effet: experimental max freq dropped from 80MHz to 75MHz
		        (state machine gets more complicated...)
		   ... still not there (mandelbrot demo displays garbage when removing
		         wait state from functions), does not enter wait loop, to be
			 checked with simulation.
	           ---> OK, need to use SSD1351_is_sending instead of !SSD1351_CS for
		         memory_wrbusy
		   ---> Still had problems at 80MHz with asm programs, removed the 'else
		         branch' in register file, seems OK now.

             - forgot to restore ra in a function (oled_write_window)

             - after reorganization of ALU (busy signal separated
	       into ALU busy + decoder needWaitAlu), I had a big
	       bug: shift by register content was no longer working !
	       It is because I forgot to set needWaitAlu in register - register shift op.
	          Debug strategy that worked:
		    1) detect bug (sieve.c was not working) -> suspected weird interaction
		       with UART (but in fact it was not the problem)
		    2) minimal example
		    3) send data to LED, made sure the problem was still there 
		       -> ruled-out UART problem
		       -> identified shift instruction as the culprit
		    4) simulation + display of word sent to the LEDs
		                  + full display of the processor's state.

             - get_char() "clicking" twice: it was <enter> generating CR,LF!
  
             - I had swapped LB,LBU and LH,LHU: this is counter-intuitive:
  	         bit is 1 for arith versus logical shifts
	         bit is 0 for load arith versus load logical

             - register write back was writing stuff in some registers
               when Id was zero ! Added a test. 
  
             - ALU output is no longer latched, so that it is immediatly
               available in EXECUTE state (and I no longer need to activate
               it in the DECODE stage, which was WRONG because register outputs
               were not ready). On the other end, longer critical path (maybe 
               doing so is BAD...)
  
             - CALL/RET was not working: it is because when writing-back PC+4,
               PC already had PC_next value. Now write backs that need to occur
               during WAIT state (that is, shifts) have now their own state
               (WAIT_INSTR_AND_ALU). All other write backs occur during EXECUTE
               state (then followed by WAIT_INSTR state).

               -> associated comment and combinatorial formula for writeBack:
                // Do not write back when state == WAIT_INSTR, because
 	        //   - in that case, was already written back during EXECUTE
                //   - at that time, PCplus4 is already incremented (and JAL needs
                //     the current one to be written back)
                // writeBack = (state == EXECUTE && writeBackEn) || 
                //	       (state == WAIT_ALU_OR_DATA && !aluBusy);
               -> now moved to a latch, updated in the state machine (cleaner I think,
	        and probably reduces the critical path).
   

             - verilator --lint-only detected a couple of width mismatch 
                in the RAM controller that explained load/store address mismatch  
  
             - there were several bugs in my RAM array *test program* (register clashes,
                and forgot to save ra when calling func from func).
  
             - OLed: I had forgotten to program the shifter
                     I was doing stupid things for generating the write clock
                     (it is simply the negated clock !)
 
             - addi reg,-5 was adding 5
                    opqual was wrong ! bit 30 is also used by imms, 
                    thus it was changing ops
                    (in particular for negative numbers !)
                    Found out with icarus
  
             - li sp,0xff8 generates an invalid opcode ? 
                     (maybe extended instructions ?)

             - experienced wrong opcode in the LEDs demo program,
	         by specifying linker options -m elf32lriscv_ilp32 -b elf32-littleriscv
		 it fixed the problem (but I do not know exactly what
                 it means, maybe it was using some 64-bits specific instructions or someting...)

             - freq adapter for OLED screen: to really figure out what happens, had to write
	         chronograms and think carefully to understand how my own design sends the
		 clocks in the middle of the serialized bits. Now I have a much better
		 understanding (femtosoc.v.SSD1351_divider). Note that some work is still needed
		 to toggle CS at the right moment after the last bit (I probably do that too soon,
		 since it is done as soon as count reaches zero, which happens right in the middle
		 of the bit, need to wait for the other half if divider is greater than 2).
		 What improved much: management of (latched) CS:
		     ** write: set CS to 1 (and bitcount to 8 etc...)
		     ** on posedge clk:
		     if(SSD1351_slow_cnt == SSD1351_cnt_max) begin
		     	if(SSD1351_sending) begin
		           if(SSD1351_CS) begin
		               SSD1351_CS <= 1'b0;
	                   end else begin
		               SSD1351_bitcount <= SSD1351_bitcount - 4'd1;
		               SSD1351_shifter <= {SSD1351_shifter[6:0], 1'b0};
	                   end
	                end else begin 
	                   SSD1351_CS  <= 1'b1;  
	                end
	             end
		     (in other word: first slow clk triggers CS, then next clks shift,
		      and finally last clk switches CS off)

             - SPI Flash memory reader: I had several difficulties:
	          1) stupid errors in the shifter (shift left<->right, MSB<->LSB, which bits to copy)
		  2) CS was combinatorially wired to busy, making it deactivating the chip too soon
		     (on the fast clock). Replaced it with a latch, activated on write, and stopped
		     on slow clock rising edge if not busy.

             - SDCard reader: the fat access library was hanging. It
                 was coming from the -O3 optimization flag, that is
                 super-smart, and that recognizes clearing loops, replacing them with
                 calls to memset(), including in the implementation of memset() ->
		 infinite recursion !!

   DEBUGGING THE STATE MACHINE, lessons taken:
   
   Now I think I better understand what's going on, by thinking about it like that:
     Rule 1: x <= y:   x is ready right at the beginning
                       of the *next* state.
     Rule 2: whenever registers or memory are involved,
                  one needs an additional cycle right
                  after register Id or mem address changed
                  before getting the value.
   
   Important:
      Carefully chose the states and their names !
      Keep in mind what's ready (and not) at the beginning of each state,
       especially when memory is involved (as well as registers since they
       are in BRAM here).




  TODO / IDEAS:
        DESIGN
             - Tests RISC-V (c.f. PICORV32), dans simulateur et 'on device' si possible
             - Check all recommendations from MIT course:
                   http:web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L11_4.pdf
                   - beware of clock skew, don't gate the clock
                   - always assume that combinatorial logic glitches
                   - Never drive a critical asynchronous control signal 
                     (register clock, write enable) from the output of 
                      combinational logic.  
                   - Ensure a stable combinational output before it is sampled by CLK
                   - When needed, create glitch-free signals by registering outputs.
                   - Synchronize all asynchronous signals, Use two back-to-back registers  
                         http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L09_4.pdf
                   - Do I have ill-formed pipelines ? (slide 14)
             - Need to find a way of latching ALU output, in order to break
               critical path (maxfreq is now 37 MHz, we can probably do 50 MHz)
               Critical path is way too long, need to insert registers in IO controller
               and maybe in other places (but I'm really running out of LUTs)
	         -> improved it (now 45 - 50 MHz depending on configured peripherals),
		    and seems to work well at 60 MHz
		 -> one-hot state machine, peripherals -> now > 50 MHz, and OK at 85 MHz   
             DONE - Gain some LUTs by reducing address bus width in RAM and mapped IO 
                and latched addresses (and this will also reduce the critical path since
                the adder is plugged on it !)
             DONE - Maybe gain some LUTs by not storing the two LSBs of the PC counter, and do

DONE: from Harvard to Von Neumann
   - one unique address bus (+ instr prefetch register management)
   NEXT:
     1) fusion ROM and RAM in single component
        (use same memory map for now, replace first page of RAM
         with ROM, mandelbrot demo fits (232 words !!)
         --> DONE
     2) fusion data bus
         --> DONE
     3) use smthg similar to Claire's interface for memory, 
            move read sign expansion into processor --> DONE 
            keep write mask in memory (but adapted) --> DONE
     4) cleaner scripts to generate initial RAM content & no longer
        distingish ROM/RAM --> DONE
     5) simulation backend --> DONE
     6) resize address bus to save LUTs --> DONE
     7) investigate error flag behavior
          --> test with simpler ALU (temporarily deactivate
              shifts...) / latch for ALUbusy... --> DONE
	  --> DONE (little delay at startup, like in PicoSOC for icebreaker)    
     8) investigate critical path that seems to connect things that
        should not be connected.
