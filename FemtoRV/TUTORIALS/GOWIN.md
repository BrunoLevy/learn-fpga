GOWIN TANG NANO Tutorial
========================

There exists packages for Linux distributions
(nextpnr-gowin,nextpnr-gowin-chipdb,python3-apycula) but they
are outdated, one needs to use the new nextpnr-himbaechel instead
(thank you @YRabbit for telling me).

Let's see how to install them from sources:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
make
sudo make install
```
